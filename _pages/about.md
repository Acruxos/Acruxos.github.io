Greetings! I'm Xiaotian Ye (叶笑天), a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), and also a research intern at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). I'm an intern student at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml) and the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shu Wu](http://shuwu.name/).

Currently, my research interests primarily focus on **Large Language Models, particularly on the knowledge editing of LLMs**, and aim to explore **AI for Science** in the future. I have a fervent passion for utilizing the power of artificial intelligence and unlocking the vast potential of large language models, and am particularly intrigued by the prospect of exploiting their capacity to propel substantial advancements across various scientific realms. Beyond my research, I am also passionate about Competitive Programming. I was an active participant in algorithmic contests and had the honor of winning an international silver medal in ICPC - Asia Regional Contest.
