Greetings! I'm Xiaotian Ye (叶笑天), second-year undergraduate in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), and a research intern at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [(CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). I work at [CRIPAC](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), [NLPR](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shu Wu](http://shuwu.name/).

My research focuses on **Large Language Models, particularly their content safety and interpretability**, and I'm currently working on **locating and editing factual knowledge in LLMs**. I am willing to contribute to the development of reliable and trustworthy AI systems, enhancing our ability to leverage these technologies to drive greater progress in various fields. Beyond my research, I am also passionate about Competitive Programming and have received a silver medal in ICPC - Asia Regional Contest.
