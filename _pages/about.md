Greetings! I'm Xiaotian Ye (叶笑天), a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), and also a research intern at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [(CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). I'm an intern student at [CRIPAC](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), [NLPR](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shu Wu](http://shuwu.name/).

My research interests primarily focus on **Large Language Models, with a particular emphasis on LLM safety and interpretability**. Currently, my research centers around **locating and editing knowledge within LLMs**. I am willing to contribute to the development of truly reliable and trustworthy LLMs and AI systems, enhancing our ability to leverage these technologies to drive greater progress in various fields. Beyond my research, I am also passionate about Competitive Programming. I have been an active participant in algorithm contests and was honored to receive a silver medal in ICPC - Asia Regional Contest.
