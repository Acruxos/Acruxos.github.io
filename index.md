I'm a senior undergraduate in Computer Science at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), and a research intern at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [(CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). I work at [NLPR](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), [MAIS](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ) and work with [Dr. Mengqi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8-tCnnUAAAAJ).


My research focuses on the intersection of **knowledge mechanisms** and the **safety & trustworthiness of foundation models (LLMs/VLMs)**, and I am generally interested in a wide range of topics such as **interpretability, knowledge editing, unlearning, alignment, and agentic safety**. I have a broad interest in developing reliable and trustworthy AI systems, enhancing our ability to leverage these technologies in various fields. Beyond my research, I am also passionate about Competitive Programming and have received a silver medal in ICPC - Asia Regional Contest.
